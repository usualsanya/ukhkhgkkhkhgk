            <p>The band was created by Damon Albarn from the Britpop band Blur, and Jamie Hewlett, the co-creator of the comic book Tank Girl. Their style is known for its variety and genre blending, with influences from many different types of music, but most notably from hip-hop, dub-reggae, electro, and pop. More recently, they have also obtained influences from R&B, soul, and Chicago house music. Damon Albarn had first met Jamie Hewlett when Blur's guitarist, Graham Coxon, had asked Hewlett to give an interview with Blur, in the 1990s and the two originally formed a hatred for each other, (Albarn stated: "I was jealous of his personality".) but it wasn't too long until the two became roommates in Trellick Tower. Damon Albarn wanted to distance himself from Blur's Britpop days and was looking for a solo career so he could experiment with other genres, but wasn't sure where to start, meanwhile Jamie Hewlett was growing tired of his Tank Girl series after the movie became a critically panned box office bomb and had no interest in continuing. The two ended up throwing several celebrity parties in their flat at Trellick Tower (which were often packed), and it was here that Gorillaz would emerge.</p>
